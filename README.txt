This repository contains my solutions for problems found at:

	https://projecteuler.net/

So far most of my solutions have been written in C, and are fairly brute-force, but I do have a few written in Scheme as well.

Some of these problems can be "solved" with a single command in Maple, for example, which isn't very sporting. I therefore decided to do as much of the problem myself, so far using only pow(..) and log(..) from math.h.

At least one person liked my solution to: 4, 7, 12

Questions/comments are welcome.

Note: Now that I have taken a course in algorithms and data structures, I could definitely do better with some of these. And I plan to do so one day when I have a bit of free time...
