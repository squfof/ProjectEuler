This repository contains my solutions for problems found at:

	https://projecteuler.net/

So far most of my solutions have been written in C, and are fairly brute-force, but I do have a few written in Scheme as well.

Some of these problems can be "solved" with a single command in Maple, for example, which isn't very sporting. I therefore decided to do as much of the problem myself, so far using only pow(..) and log(..) from math.h.

Questions/comments are welcome.
