 * Problem: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
 *          1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385.
 *          The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
 *          (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025.
 *          Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
 *          natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * 
 *          Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
 *          hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
